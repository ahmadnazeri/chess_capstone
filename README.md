# chess_capstone

This was a project that I did (when I was young) for my senior capstone. There are a lot of changes that needs to be made to the project which will be done in the version 2.0 of it. 

## Changes to be made
- a lot to list but mostly focused on better practices given what I have learn since I have graduated and been in the work force.
